# Week One

## Identify a Theme for the Dataset
For my dataset's theme I have chosen to focus on the Bulgarian Folk Song Кавал Свири (A Kaval Plays), specifically the Petar Lyondev arrangement as performed by the Ensemble Trakia on the 1998 album 'Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares Vol.2'.

The Ensemble Trakia are a Bulgarian Folklore ensemble who were establised in 1974 by Professor Cyril Dzhenev.

I have chosen to focus on this as my theme as Bulgarian Folklore music is a particular area of interest to me in my own performance practice - analysis will allow me to develop a deeper understanding of the music that I can apply practically.

Furthermore, I will be able to use my own knowledge as a traditional musician to understand and analyse the music effectively.


## Challenges Working with Music & Music Related Data
One of the most difficult challenges when working with music and music data is access to scores and notation, which becomes especially difficult when dealing with traditional musics as the majority of these traditions are transmitted orally and rarely written down.

This leads to scarcity of complete written sources, which in turn causes a lack of recordings, information, and general documentation of traditional pieces. 

I faced these issues when working with Кавал Свири within this course as it is an older arrangement of a traditional Bulgarian song I could not find an official score and had to work with a [transcription from Musescore](https://musescore.com/stagnantmilk/kaval_sviri) that I ammended slightly.

This lack of official written scores is a recurring issue within my studies of traditional music as while there are many resources being created for documenting these tunes and songs in a written format their scope is still limited - particularly when it comes to traditional Bulgarian music there are few resources freely available outside of the oral tradition.
