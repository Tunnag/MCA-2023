# Comparison of MusicXML and MEI
An important consideration to be taken when comparing MusicXML and MEI is that while they do have similarities they have two different goals, as specified on the [MEI Website](https://music-encoding.org/about/#:~:text=How%20is%20MEI%20different%20from,interchange%20format%20between%20notation%20editors.) - MusicXML is primarily focused on being interchangable between notation editors while MEI is primarily focused on the encoding of a scores notation and intellectual content.
