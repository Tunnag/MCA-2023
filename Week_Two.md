# Week Two
Converting a PDF of the tune 1st August (tune 1 of 2 from the Second track of the album) into a musescore file, and then comparing with the original PDF to find areas in which the OMR fails to convert the PDF properly.

## What didn't transfer well?
- Did not transfer over metadata i.e the title of the tune, the composer, the type of tune, etc

- As the PDF did not feature a tempo marking, the OMR inserted an invisible one of 120bpm (the default of Musescore).

- Triplets were not properly annotated (missing the 3 underneath).

- Prima and Seconda Volti were not properly transfered, instead showing it as a 99 Volta.

- Bar spacing of the volti did not transfer properly, put the seconda volta as a single bar on its own line of music.

- Inserted an uneccessary (and redundant) clef and key signature midway through the piece.
