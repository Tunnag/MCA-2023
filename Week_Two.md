# Week Two
For this section I converted my PDF Score of Кавал Свири to a Musescore file using the OMR (Optical Music Recognition) provided by the [Musescore Website](musescore.com/import).

## What didn't transfer well?
- Did not transfer over metadata i.e the title of the tune, the composer, the type of tune, etc

- The tempo marking present in the original score was also not recognised by the OMR.

- Prima and Seconda Volti were not properly transfered, instead showing it as a 99 Volta.

- None of the lyric text underneath was successfully picked up by the OMR, there seems to be a common issue with text recognition with OMR as the text mentioned in my first bullet point was also not recognised.

- There are pedal markings present on the OMR score, a marking exclusive to piano and not possible with the human voice - this is most likely due to the lines representing the length of a syllable in the original score being interpreted as pedal lines.

- While note recognition throughout the OMR score was mostly correct, there are a few instances where incorrect note values and pitches are written including a few instances where a full chord of semibreves was inserted inplace of the actual bar's original content.

- In a vocal score markings such as dynamics are typically placed above the stave they refer to as the lyrics are placed below, however the OMR has inconsistently placed these markings above and below the stave across the OMR score.
