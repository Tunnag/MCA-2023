# Week Seven

## Reasons for Metadata Choices

When considering Genre I added Folk & World as these were the genres indicated on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/2267463-Various-Le-Myst%C3%A8re-Des-Voix-Bulgares-Volume-2). Additionally I added the Bulgarian Folk & Choir genres to the piece to add some more specificity to its classification.

For the licensing data I used the information from the album notes section on [Discogs](//www.discogs.com/release/2267463-Various-Le-Myst%C3%A8re-Des-Voix-Bulgares-Volume-2).
