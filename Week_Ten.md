## Similarity Matrix

In generating this similarity matrix, I used the tracks provided but replaced three of them with the audio tracks of the three sections of Кавал Свири I created for the previous section. This results in the following Track List being used:

- Tracks 0-3 - Classical
- Tracks 4-6 - Rock
- Tracks 7-9 - Bulgarian Folk

The simalirity matrix was generated by comparing the levels of C's and A's in each track.

When reviewing the resulting scatterplot graph, only two symbols for Bulgarian Folk are showing - although in testing by changing the opacity of the symbols one of the diamonds was darker than the other implying that two of the tracks contain the same levels of C's and A's.

### Comparison

The transcribed score was created via Sonic Visualiser from an audio file of the original score.

Similarly, to the score transcribed via OMR in Week Two, the transcribed score shown above here is also missing a lot of vital information and formatting in order to make it a useable and accurate score of the piece.

Among the most obvious issues:

- The lyrics featured in the original score are missing, due to the transcribed score being created purely from the lyric-less WAV file
- Additionally, no text of any form found on the original has transferred, including dynamics, title/subtitle, and part names.
- The transcription has not correctly picked up on the parts of the score, converting a piece for four voices into a piano solo.
- The key signature and harmony have not been translated correctly, and while still fundamentally similar in terms of pure harmony the voicings of chords are entirely incorrect.
- For the most part rhythm has been inaccurately transcribed, as the original goes between 3/4 and 9/8 but the transcription is in 4/4 - as the score progresses these inaccuracies in rhythm become much more noticeable.
