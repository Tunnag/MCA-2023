## Task Two - Identify a Theme for the Dataset
One or more tracks from the LÃºnasa album 'The Merry Sisters of Fate', using thesession.org as a source.

## Task Three - Challenges Working with Music & Music Related Data
I will be using thesession.org as a source of sheet music and links to recordings, this is an a database of Irish Music that anyone can add a setting ("version") of  tune to so difficulties could arise from trying to find the exact setting used in the recording.
