## Task Two - Identify a Theme for the Dataset
For my dataset's theme I have chosen to focus on the band Lúnasa, specifically several tracks from their 2006 album "The Merry Sisters of Fate".

Lúnasa are a contemporary Irish traditional music band who formed in 1997 and have seena shifting line up over their time touring.

I have chosen to focus on Lúnasa as my theme as I am familiar with their music, and additionally as a traditional musician myself I feel that I have a deeper understanding of their music and musical approach that will help me complete further tasks to a higher standard.

Furthermore, I will be able to use my own knowledge as a traditional musican to source the musical data that is required for further tasks. To gather this data I shall be using [thesession.org](thesession.org), a community run website that acts as a database of Sheet Music, Recordings and discussion forums regarding traditional music from Ireland, Scotland and beyond.


## Task Three - Challenges Working with Music & Music Related Data
I will be using thesession.org as a source of sheet music and links to recordings, this is an a database of Irish Music that anyone can add a setting ("version") of  tune to so difficulties could arise from trying to find the exact setting used in the recording.
