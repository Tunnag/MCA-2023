The simplest way to visualise a piano roll is as though a piano keyboard lies along the Y axis showing the pitch of a note, and the X axis shows the measure number showing the length of the note by its length along the X axis.

From the piano rolls above, we can clearly see that over the first 10 measures Soprano 1 is leading the melody supported by a harmony from Soprano 2 that remains mostly on the same note. We can also see that both altos do not join in until partway through bar 8.

Piano rolls display pitch against time much like sheet music, however the ones above only display one part at a time which can make analysing them against each other more difficult.

A Pitch Class Histogram shows the number of times each note occurs throughout a piece, with the pitches along the X axis and the number of occurences along the Y.

For the first ten bars of Кавал Свири the Pitch Class Histogram shows the two most commonly occuring notes to be E and B, which confirms that the opening section is based around an E minor chord - this form of analysis can be useful to quickly gauge what key a piece may be in.
