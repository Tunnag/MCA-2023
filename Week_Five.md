## Creating a Metadata Schema

In preparation for Week Seven, I have created a Metadata Schema that has been added to my [updated MEI File](data/Kaval_Sviri_Updated.mei)

For my schema I have selected the following elements:

- Title
- Composer
- Arranger
- Tempo
- Ensemble
- Language
- Genre
- Licensing
- Date Encoded

As the piece I have chosen for my theme is not a common one it can be difficult to find reliable Metadata, however I feel that these elements (in some cases requiring translation) are the most important in describing Кавал Свири.
