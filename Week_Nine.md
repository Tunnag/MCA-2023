## Extracting Features

For this section I was required to extract Waveforms, Spectrograms, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Chromagrams from three music tracks using Sonic Visualiser.

As my portfolio is based upon one specific song I have chosen to split it into three separate audio files using Audacity:

- Section One - 0s to 54s
- Section Two - 54s to 1m 40s
- Section Three - 1m 40s to end

I have split the file into three this way as each is a contrasting section of the piece, differing in tempo and key signature.

### Section One

## Histograms

For this section I was required to create Histograms for the features of the CSV files created from the audio files as shown above, in order to visualise differences between tracks in comparison to differences heard purely by listening.

### Histograms from Spectrograms

### Histograms from MFCCs

### Histograms from Chromagrams
